## Skill Selection & Orchestration
You have a vast library of specialized skills available. **Use them proactively** — don't wing it when a skill exists for the task.

### How Skill Selection Works
1. **Before starting any implementation task**, mentally scan your available skills for matches.
2. If a relevant skill exists, **read its SKILL.md first**, then follow its guidance.
3. **Announce your choice**: *"I am invoking the [skill-name] skill to ensure this follows best practices."*
4. When multiple skills could apply, invoke the most specific one (e.g., `react-patterns` over `frontend-design` for a React component).
5. **When in doubt, invoke the skill.** Reading a SKILL.md costs 30 seconds. Getting it wrong costs hours.

### When to Invoke Skills (Non-Negotiable)
- **Building with a specific framework/library** → find the matching skill (React, Next.js, Django, FastAPI, etc.)
- **Touching security** (auth, input validation, secrets, API exposure) → invoke a security skill
- **Writing tests** → invoke the testing skill for your language/framework
- **Designing a database schema or API** → invoke the design/architecture skill
- **Debugging a bug** → invoke `systematic-debugging` before guessing
- **Deploying or containerizing** → invoke the deployment skill for your platform
- **Integrating a payment provider, email service, or external API** → check for a dedicated skill first
- **Working with AI/LLM features** → invoke the relevant AI skill (RAG, agents, prompts)
- **Writing documentation** → invoke the documentation skill for the format you need
- **Unfamiliar domain or new library** → research skill first, then build

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Skip skills because "I already know this" — the skill may have guardrails you'd miss
- ❌ Hardcode patterns from memory when a skill has the latest best practices
- ❌ Use a generic approach when a project-specific skill exists

## AI Discipline Rules (Prevent Common AI Failures)

### No Scope Creep
- **ONLY implement what's asked or what's next in `docs/progress.md`.** Do not add features, helpers, utilities, or "nice-to-haves" that aren't in the spec.
- If you think something SHOULD be added, ASK the user first. Never add it silently.

### No Phantom Dependencies
- **NEVER import a package that isn't in the dependency file** (requirements.txt / package.json / etc). Add it FIRST, then use it.
- Before using any library method, **verify it exists** in that version. Don't hallucinate API methods.

### No Placeholder Code
- **NEVER write `# TODO`, `pass`, `...`, or `NotImplementedError`** as final code. Every function must be fully implemented before marking the task done.

### No Hallucinated APIs
- Before calling any external library method, **verify the method exists** by checking docs or the installed package.
- If unsure, say so and check rather than assuming.

### No Silent Failures
- **NEVER write code that swallows errors silently.** Every `except`/`catch` block must either re-raise, log, or return a meaningful error.
- `except: pass` / `catch {}` is permanently BANNED.

### No Over-Engineering
- Match the spec's complexity level. No abstractions without 2+ concrete implementations.
- Build for the scale defined in the spec, not 100x that.

### Verify Before Claiming
- **NEVER say "done" or "all tests pass" without actually running the tests** and showing the output.
- **NEVER say "this follows the spec" without having read the relevant section** in this session.
- If you haven't read a file in this conversation, you don't know what's in it. Read it first.

### Full Read Rule (CRITICAL — Prevents Context Loss)
- **When ANY workflow instructs you to "read" a file, you MUST read the ENTIRE file from first line to last line.**
- If the file is longer than your read limit, make multiple sequential read calls (e.g., lines 1–200, 201–400, 401–end) until **every line has been read.**
- Do NOT read a partial subset and assume you understand the rest. Critical rules, patterns, and constraints are often buried later in the file.
- This applies universally to: PRD, `progress.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md`, Shared Foundation files, source files referenced in tasks, and any other file a workflow tells you to read.

### Read Shared Foundation Before Coding (CRITICAL — Prevents Duplication)
- Before writing ANY new utility, helper, middleware, handler, component, or shared pattern, read every file listed in the **Shared Foundation** table in `CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md`.
- If a pattern, function, or module already exists there — **USE IT.** Do not recreate it.

### Workflow Discipline
- **Max 25 workflow files** in `.agent/workflows/`. If approaching 25, retire rarely-used workflows or convert procedural knowledge to reusable global skills.

### Search Before Creating (CRITICAL — Prevents Duplicate Code)
- **Before creating ANY new file, function, class, or utility**, search the codebase first:
  1. Search file contents for the function/class name
  2. Search for the file by name
  3. Check relevant module exports / `__init__` files
- If it already exists, **USE IT**. Do not recreate it.
- If a similar function exists, **extend it** — don't create a parallel version.
- When in doubt, **ASK the user**: "I can't find X — does it exist, or should I create it?"

### Use Skills When Available (Skills > Pre-trained Knowledge)
- Before implementing any task, scan your available skills list for domain matches.
- If a matching skill exists (e.g., database → `postgresql`, auth → `auth-implementation-patterns`, payments → `stripe-integration`), read its `SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.
- **CRITICAL:** The patterns, architectures, and rules defined in a `SKILL.md` STRICTLY OVERRIDE your general pre-trained knowledge. Always choose the skill's approach over what you "think you know."
- **Always announce:** *"Using skill: [skill-name] for this task."* so the user knows which patterns are being applied.
- If no skill matches, proceed normally.
